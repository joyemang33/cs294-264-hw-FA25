Use subprocess.run and PGPASSWORD for client in postgres backend

Replaced creation of a temporary .pgpass file with passing the password to psql
via the PGPASSWORD environment variable using subprocess.run(..., env=..., check=True).
Preserved SIGINT handling to allow psql to abort queries, and restored the original
SIGINT handler in a finally block.
