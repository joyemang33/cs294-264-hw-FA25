You’ve hit old SymPy behavior: earlier versions implemented Point * scalar but not scalar * Point. 

- Your working line uses Point.__mul__ (point2*2.0), which existed.
- The failing line would need Point.__rmul__ (2.0*point2). Without it, SymPy leaves a symbolic Mul(2.0, Point2D(...)), and Point.__add__ can’t add that to a Point, hence the error.

Fix
- Upgrade SymPy to version 1.5 or newer (pip install -U sympy). From 1.5 onward Point.__rmul__ exists, so both orders work:
  p1 + 2*p2
  p1 + p2*2

If you can’t upgrade, use a workaround
- Keep right-multiplication: p1 + p2*2
- Or temporary monkey‑patch:
  from sympy.geometry import Point
  Point.__rmul__ = Point.__mul__

Tip: Check your version:
import sympy; print(sympy.__version__)
