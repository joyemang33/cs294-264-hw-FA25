+Pytest 6: Dynamically-added xfail marker regression
+==================================================
+
+Summary
+-------
+In pytest 6.0.x a regression caused dynamically adding an xfail marker during the runtest phase
+(for example, calling request.node.add_marker(pytest.mark.xfail(...)) from inside a test) to be
+ignored â€” a failing test would be reported as a normal failure instead of XFAIL. This behavior
+differs from pytest 5.x.
+
+Cause and fix
+--------------
+The issue was identified in pytest issue #7486 and fixed by pull request #7490 (merged July 15, 2020).
+The fix restores refreshing of marks when needed during runtest so dynamically-added xfail markers
+are respected.
+
+What to do
+---------
+1. Upgrade pytest to a version that includes the fix (pytest 6 with the merged PR or later).
+   - Run: pip install -U pytest
+   - Confirm with: pytest --version
+
+2. If you cannot upgrade immediately, use one of these workarounds:
+   - Call pytest.xfail("reason") at the point in the test where you decide it should xfail.
+     This will stop the test and report XFAIL.
+   - Apply the xfail marker earlier in the test lifecycle (e.g. from a fixture setup or in
+     pytest_collection_modifyitems) so the marker exists before runtest begins.
+   - Consider using a plugin such as pytest-runtime-xfail as a temporary measure.

+
+If you want, provide the output of pytest --version from the failing environment and I can
+recommend the exact minimum pytest version to upgrade to.
