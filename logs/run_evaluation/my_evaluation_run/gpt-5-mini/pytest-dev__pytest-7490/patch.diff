Re-evaluate xfail marks at report time so dynamically-added xfail markers are honored.

- src/_pytest/skipping.py: in pytest_runtest_makereport, re-evaluate xfail marks when item._store does not have an xfail evaluation yet (this handles markers added during test execution via request.node.add_marker).

Rationale:
Previously, xfail marks added during test execution could be missed because xfail evaluation happened earlier (in setup/call). By re-evaluating (and storing) the xfail status in pytest_runtest_makereport when needed, dynamically-added xfail markers are respected and failing tests are reported as xfailed as expected.

Tests:
- Ran testing/test_skipping.py (all tests passed).

Patch applied.
