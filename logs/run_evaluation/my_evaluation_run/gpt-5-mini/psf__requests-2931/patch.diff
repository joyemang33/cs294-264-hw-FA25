Fixed: avoid decoding binary request body with ascii

Change summary:
- In requests/models.py, RequestEncodingMixin._encode_params:
  * Return bytes payloads unchanged instead of calling to_native_string on them.
  * Only convert str/unicode to native string.

Rationale:
Calling to_native_string on bytes in Python 3 attempts to decode using the default encoding ('ascii'), which fails for arbitrary non-ASCII binary payloads (e.g. u"ööö".encode("utf-8")). Leaving bytes unchanged preserves binary payloads and fixes the regression introduced in 2.9 (see issue #2844).
