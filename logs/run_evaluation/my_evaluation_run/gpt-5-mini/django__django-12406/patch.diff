Updated ForeignKey.formfield to avoid adding an empty choice for required related fields when the widget is RadioSelect.

Change summary:
- File modified: django/db/models/fields/related.py
- Behavior: If a related field has blank=False (required) and a RadioSelect widget is provided (and no explicit empty_label is in kwargs), set empty_label=None so ModelChoiceField does not include the blank "---------" choice. This avoids a selected empty radio option and uses the radio's inherent unfilled state.

Rationale:
Radio inputs have an inherent "unfilled" state; adding an explicit blank choice for required ForeignKey fields makes the blank option look like a valid selectable choice. Removing the empty choice for required radio widgets produces a clearer UI.

Notes:
- The implementation detects RadioSelect by checking the widget class name to avoid importing the widgets module in this file. If desired, this can be changed to use isinstance(widget, RadioSelect) with an import.
- I could not run the test suite in this environment (pytest not found). Please run tests locally to verify.
